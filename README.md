### Three.js app approach for data collection related to people's urban perception of public space in terms of security.
</br>
One of the biggest difficulties I had when conducting surveys about security in puclic space, and which had a direct impact on the accuracy of the results obtained, was the way of collecting data : through victimization questionnaires mainly, with data collected by areas or sections of street. In addition, the small groups with which the activities were carried out, left out various social groups, resulting in biased results.</br>
In the search for greater participation and precision, I made a approach to the development of a tool, so other options for data collection began to be tested, and thus be able to represent and evaluate a series of parameters linked to safer and more inclusive public spaces.</br>
In this first one, intensity levels related to the PERCEPTION of fear/insecurity in the areas that are marked are collected and overlap. </br>
The idea is that the option to select the variables with which one will then work was included in such a way that information could be contributed online. In addition, to offer other services such as safe routes, tracking functions or GPS.
